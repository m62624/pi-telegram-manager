> ⚠️ Experimental. pi-telegram-manager is built **for local models** and, at runtime, is driven by one — a small local model (tested with Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf) running through Pi. Cloud LLMs (such as Claude) take part in its development. It is maintained with AI assistance and may contain non-professional design choices, rough edges, broken behavior, or mistakes. Use it at your own risk.

# pi-telegram-manager

An experimental [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) extension that puts a Pi agent on Telegram. It runs in one of a few **modes**, and the bot behaves very differently in each: in one it is *your* private assistant in your own chat with the bot; in another it quietly answers *other people* in your Telegram **business** chats on your behalf. The centrepiece is that **business manager** mode.

It was built **first for local models with a small context window** (the experiment ran a single local model at **131k** context through Pi). Almost every design choice here — one decision per turn ending in a tool call, strict per-chat context isolation, a last-N memory window, idle memory consolidation split into resumable fragments — exists to keep a small model coherent across many conversations without a huge context. It works with cloud models too, but that is not what it was tuned for.

This is a personal experiment. Expect rough edges, bugs, and behavior that changes.

## Modes

The **same bot account** runs one mode at a time. What the bot *is* depends entirely on the mode.

### 🤖 Personal — mode 1 (`/telegram-connect`)

Bridges your **current Pi terminal session** to your **private chat with the bot**. You talk to your own coding agent from your phone: send text, files, and images; get its replies (native rich Markdown), a live "typing…" indicator and streamed drafts; queue messages while it works; `/clear` the history or `/esc` a running turn. The bot only ever talks to **you** (`allowedUserId`); it does not touch any business chats.

### 🕵️ Business manager — mode 2 (the centrepiece)

> ✅ **No Telegram Premium, subscription, or "business account" is required.** Telegram opened **connected business bots to everyone** — [Bot API 10.0](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api-changelog), **8 May 2026**: *"Allowed Business Bots to manage user accounts without a Telegram Premium subscription."* An ordinary free account can let a bot reply on its behalf. All you do is flip one BotFather toggle and connect the bot — see [Getting started](#getting-started).

Through a Telegram **Business** connection, the bot reads your business conversations with **many different people** and decides, message by message, whether to reply **on your behalf**. One agent instance multiplexes every chat, with:

- **strict per-chat context isolation** — each turn the model sees only that one conversation, rebuilt from disk;
- a **priority queue / scheduler** — one chat active at a time, never-replied chats first, a continuation window that keeps a live conversation going;
- an **owner-reply window** — a first message from someone is held for a few minutes so *you* can answer first; only if you stay silent does the bot step in;
- **persistent per-contact memory** — durable facts about each person, saved and resurfaced across sessions, updated by an **idle consolidation** pass that pauses for live replies and resumes where it left off;
- **catch-up on activation** — when you switch it on, it looks at chats left waiting and answers the ones still worth answering;
- an optional **debug feed** — since the bot account is idle here, it can DM *you* each turn's thinking, tool calls, and decision.

Two sub-modes decide how forward it is:

| Sub-mode | Command | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 👁️ **Observer** | `/telegram-manager-observer` | Co-pilot. Only steps in when you stay silent past the owner-reply window — you always get first crack. |
| 🎛️ **Takeover** | `/telegram-manager-takeover` | The bot fully runs the business chats and replies on its own. |

### ⏹️ Switching modes from the chat (`/switch`)

Send **`/switch`** in your private chat with the bot (or tap it in the command menu) to flip between **Observer / Takeover / Personal / Stop** from an inline keyboard — no terminal needed. It is a **priority** action: it aborts whatever the bot is doing (even a long memory consolidation) and switches immediately. A **pinned message** at the top of that chat always shows the currently active mode, updated in place on every switch.

---

## Getting started

### 1. Create the bot (BotFather)

In Telegram, open [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), send `/newbot`, and follow the prompts to name your bot. BotFather replies with an **HTTP API token** (`123456:ABC-…`) — this is your `botToken`.

### 2. Enable Business Mode — required for the manager mode

The **business manager** mode receives messages through a Telegram **Business connection**, and a bot can only be connected to a business account if **Business Mode** is turned on for it. This is a one-time BotFather toggle:

> `@BotFather` → `/mybots` → *select your bot* → **Bot Settings** → **Business Mode** → **Turn on**

There is no special "business bot" type and nothing to pay for on the *bot's* side — just this toggle. (Personal mode does not need it.)

### 3. Find your Telegram user id

`allowedUserId` is your **numeric** user id (not your @username) — the only account the bot obeys. Get it by messaging a lookup bot such as [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) or [@getidsbot](https://t.me/getidsbot); it replies with your `Id`.

### 4. Install the extension

```bash
pi install git:github.com/m62624/pi-telegram-manager
```

### 5. Configure

Create the settings file at `<pi-agent-dir>/extensions/pi-telegram-manager/settings.json` (typically `~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-telegram-manager/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "botToken": "123456:ABC-your-bot-token",
  "allowedUserId": 419332999,
  "manager": { "ownerName": "Alex" }
}
```

`botToken` may instead be `"env:TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"` to read it from the environment.

### 6. (Manager mode only) Connect the bot to your account

Open Telegram **Settings → Telegram Business → Chatbots**, enter your bot's username, and choose which chats it may access.

> ✅ **No Telegram Premium or paid subscription is required.** Telegram opened **connected business bots to all users** in [Bot API 10.0](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api-changelog) (**8 May 2026**: *"Allowed Business Bots to manage user accounts without a Telegram Premium subscription."*) — a bot can reply on your behalf from an ordinary, free account. There is nothing to buy: on the bot's side you only need Business Mode enabled (step 2), and on your side just connect it here. The people who message you need nothing either.

Then open Pi and run one of the commands below. The extension loads `./src/index.ts` directly — no build step is needed to run it, only a Pi session restart after changes.

---

## Commands

**In the Pi terminal:**

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/telegram-connect` | Start **Personal** mode (bind this session to your DM) |
| `/telegram-disconnect` | Stop Personal mode |
| `/telegram-manager-observer` | Start the **business manager** in Observer sub-mode |
| `/telegram-manager-takeover` | Start the **business manager** in Takeover sub-mode |
| `/telegram-manager-stop` | Stop the business manager |
| `/telegram-switch` | Open the mode-switcher panel in your bot DM |
| `/telegram-status` | Show the active mode |

**In your chat with the bot** (owner only): `/switch` (mode picker), and in Personal mode `/clear`, `/esc`, `/help`.

---

## Settings

All settings live in one JSON file: `<pi-agent-dir>/extensions/pi-telegram-manager/settings.json`. Every key is optional and layered over the defaults below. Unknown keys are ignored with a warning; a present-but-wrong-typed value fails loudly with the offending path.

**Override semantics.** For plain values (numbers, booleans, strings) a setting **replaces** the default. Two list settings are special: instruction-file lists are **appended** to the built-in instructions (they add to them, never replace them), and `manager.mentionWords` / `manager.allowedTools` **replace** the default list / **add** to the built-in tools as noted per row.

### Top level

| Key | Default | Override | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `botToken` | — | replaces | Telegram bot token, or `"env:VAR"` to read it from the environment. Required. |
| `allowedUserId` | — | replaces | Your Telegram numeric user id — the **only** user the bot obeys and the DM it uses for Personal mode, `/switch`, and the debug feed. Required for mode 1 and for `/switch`. |
| `timezone` | system zone | replaces | IANA timezone (e.g. `"Asia/Almaty"`) for the `[Now: …]` line shown to the model. |
| `instructionFiles` | `[]` | **appended** | Markdown files added to the system instructions in **both** modes. |

### `assistant` (Personal mode)

| Key | Default | Override | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `assistant.rendering` | `"rich"` | replaces | `"rich"` (native Bot API rich Markdown) or `"html"`. |
| `assistant.draftPreviews` | `true` | replaces | Stream the reply as an animated draft while it generates. |
| `assistant.toolActivity` | `true` | replaces | Mirror each agent tool call to the chat as a collapsible block. |
| `connect.instructionFiles` | `[]` | **appended** | Extra instruction files for Personal mode only. |

### `connectionCheck` (connection watchdog, both modes)

A silent timer probes the bot connection while a mode is active; after too many consecutive failures the mode auto-disconnects. Probes never post to chat or the debug feed — only the final auto-disconnect is surfaced.

| Key | Default | Override | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `connectionCheck.enabled` | `true` | replaces | Run the watchdog while a mode is active. |
| `connectionCheck.intervalMs` | `600000` (10 min) | replaces | Probe interval. `0` also disables it. |
| `connectionCheck.maxRetries` | `3` | replaces | Consecutive failed probes tolerated before auto-disconnect. |

### `manager` (business manager, mode 2)

| Key | Default | Override | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `manager.ownerName` | — | replaces | Your display name, so the bot can introduce itself as "{name}'s assistant" on first contact. |
| `manager.ownerReplyWindowMs` | `300000` (5 min) | replaces | How long a first message from someone is held so **you** can answer before the bot may. |
| `manager.continueWindowMs` | `90000` (1:30) | replaces | After the bot replies, how long the chat stays "live" (a new message keeps it active instead of re-queuing). Also governs when things are quiet enough to resume memory consolidation. |
| `manager.liveFreshnessMs` | `120000` (2 min) | replaces | A message older than this (by its true send time) is recorded for context but does **not** wake a live reply cycle — so a redelivered old backlog never "wakes" the bot. |
| `manager.catchUpWindowMs` | `36000000` (10 h) | replaces | On activation, the bot may answer for you in a waiting chat only if its last message is newer than this. |
| `manager.reopenAfterMs` | `86400000` (24 h) | replaces | A chat resuming after this much silence is re-greeted. `0` disables re-greeting. |
| `manager.rememberMessages` | `20` | replaces | Last-N messages per chat the model reads each turn. Also bounds the transcript kept on disk (old messages are pruned to ~2× this). |
| `manager.factsLimit` | `20` | replaces | Last-N durable facts kept and injected per contact. |
| `manager.factConsolidationQuietMs` | `1800000` (30 min) | replaces | Quiet period after a chat's last activity before an idle memory-consolidation pass may run on it. |
| `manager.verifyLimit` | `8` | replaces | Max candidate facts individually verified in one consolidation pass. |
| `manager.reviseThreshold` | `2` | replaces | How many times a drafted reply may be reconsidered when new messages keep arriving mid-turn before it is sent as-is. `0` sends immediately. |
| `manager.strictReplyGuard` | `true` | replaces | Drop a reply the model itself tagged as chatter/acknowledgement (or "no reply needed") unless it was directly addressed. Curbs a weak model over-replying to banter. |
| `manager.mentionWords` | `["llm", "manager"]` | **replaces list** | Wake-words (case-insensitive). A message containing one skips the owner-reply window; the model still decides whether it is really addressed. `[]` disables. |
| `manager.labeler` | `"LLM agent 🤖:"` | replaces | Prefix rendered before each outgoing business reply (`""` = none). |
| `manager.debugFeed` | `false` | replaces | Mirror every turn (thinking, tool calls, decision) to your bot DM. Chatty in Observer — opt-in. |
| `manager.media.images` | `true` | replaces | Let the model see interlocutor images (vision). |
| `manager.media.documents` | `false` | replaces | Accept non-image documents (otherwise refused). |
| `manager.allowedTools` | `[]` | **adds to base** | Regex names of extra tools the model may call, on top of the built-in messaging tools. Empty = telegram-sandbox (messaging tools only, no computer access). |
| `manager.instructionFiles` | `[]` | **appended** | Extra instruction files for the manager. |
| `manager.firstMessageTemplate` | — | replaces | Override file for the first-contact greeting template. |
| `manager.reopenTemplate` | — | replaces | Override file for the re-opening greeting template. |
| `manager.observer.interlocutorInstructionFile` | — | replaces | Observer: extra instructions for handling the interlocutor. |
| `manager.observer.ownerInstructionFile` | — | replaces | Observer: extra instructions about the owner. |
| `manager.takeover.instructionFile` | — | replaces | Takeover: extra instructions. |

### `files`

| Key | Default | Override | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `files.maxBytes` | `52428800` (50 MiB) | replaces | Size cap for describing/downloading inbound attachments. |
| `files.downloadDir` | Pi's working dir | replaces | Where files sent to the bot (Personal mode) are saved. Absolute or `~`-relative. |

> **Reserved keys** — `manager.responseMode`, `manager.markRead`, `manager.throttleMs`, and `manager.subMode` are parsed for forward-compatibility but are **not wired to behavior yet**. Setting them does nothing today (the active sub-mode comes from the command you run).

---

## Timing at a glance (defaults)

Tuned for a **local model** answering over minutes, not milliseconds. Slower hardware → consider raising the windows.

| Window | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Owner-reply | 5 min | you get first crack at a new message |
| Continuation | 1 min 30 s | how long a chat stays "live" after a reply |
| Live freshness | 2 min | older messages are backlog, not a live trigger |
| Consolidation quiet | 30 min | idle wait before updating memory about a chat |
| Re-greet after | 24 h | silence before a resuming chat is welcomed back |
| Catch-up window | 10 h | oldest waiting message still worth answering on start |
| Connection check | 10 min | silent liveness probe interval |
